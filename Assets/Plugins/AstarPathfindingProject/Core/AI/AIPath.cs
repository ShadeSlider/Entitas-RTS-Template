/** AI for following paths.
 * This AI is the default movement script which comes with the A* Pathfinding Project.
 * It is in no way required by the rest of the system, so feel free to write your own. But I hope this script will make it easier
 * to set up movement for the characters in your game.
 * This script works well for many types of units, but if you need the highest performance (for example if you are moving hundreds of characters) you
 * may want to customize this script or write a custom movement script to be able to optimize it specifically for your game.
 * \n
 * \n
 * This script will try to follow a target transform. At regular intervals, the path to that target will be recalculated.
 * It will in the #Update method try to move towards the next point in the path.
 * However it will only move in roughly forward direction (Z+ axis) of the character, but it will rotate around it's Y-axis
 * to make it possible to reach the target.
 *
 * \section variables Quick overview of the variables
 * In the inspector in Unity, you will see a bunch of variables. You can view detailed information further down, but here's a quick overview.\n
 * The #repathRate determines how often it will search for new paths, if you have fast moving targets, you might want to set it to a lower value.\n
 * The #target variable is where the AI will try to move, it can be a point on the ground where the player has clicked in an RTS for example.
 * Or it can be the player object in a zombie game.\n
 * The speed is self-explanatory, so is #rotationSpeed, however #slowdownDistance might require some explanation.
 * It is the approximate distance from the target where the AI will start to slow down.\n
 * #pickNextWaypointDist is simply determines within what range it will switch to target the next waypoint in the path.\n
 *
 * Below is an image illustrating several variables as well as some internal ones, but which are relevant for understanding how it works.
 * \note The image is slightly outdated, replace forwardLook with pickNextWaypointDist in the image and ignore the circle for pickNextWaypointDist.
 *
 * \shadowimage{aipath_variables.png}
 * This script has many movement fallbacks.
 * If it finds an RVOController attached to the same GameObject as this component, it will use that. If it fins a character controller it will also use that.
 * Lastly if will fall back to simply modifying Transform.position which is guaranteed to always work and is also the most performant option.
