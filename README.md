# Entitas RTS Template for Unity
## These template includes:
- Basic config management (general, input, hotkeys)
- Very basic writing/reading of config files (using JSON.net)
- Custom Code Generator example (used for initializing entities from GameObjects)
- Universal user input processing (mouse and keyboard events)
- Basic Tick systems and game pausing mechanics
- Basic tweening integration (using DOTween)
- RTS-style camera controls
- Initializing entities from GameObjects in the scene
- Click and drag selection of selectable GameObjects
- Right click navigation and pathfinding (using A* Pathfinding Project)

## Disclaimer 
This template has been cut out of my existing project which is very much a WIP, so it is by no means a finished and polished product. I do hope, though, that it might be of help for those who are just starting out with ECS and Entitas.

## A note about initializing entities from GameObjects in the scene
This template uses an 'older' approach of mine: generated MonoBehaviours for each component.
The most recent and much more convenient one uses Odin Inspector asset and is described [here](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/issues/515). 
The ```ViewableEntityInitializer``` MonoBehaviour and ```InitSceneEntitiesSystem``` system that works with Odin are included in this project and have and \*Odin suffix in their file names.
